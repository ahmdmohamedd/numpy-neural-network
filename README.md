# numpy-neural-network
This project builds neural network from scratch using NumPy, solving the XOR problem. Two versions are included: one utilizing the Sigmoid activation function and another employing ReLU for the hidden layer. Each model demonstrates essential concepts in neural networks, including forward propagation, backpropagation, and activation functions.
